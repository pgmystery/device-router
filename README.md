# device-router
This is my final project for the web development course of neuefische GmbH in Hamburg.

With this project, you can connect your Linux/Mac OS/BSD running device with the App over the Internet and connect to the Bash over your webbrowser.
For example, you can connect an Raspberry Pie with the App and controller it! The good part is, that it runs over the Internet and it doesn't matter where you are or where your device is, both needs only an Internet connect to work.
